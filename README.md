## üî• How to run the application locally?

Before to run the Docker command, you will need to create in the root of the project a file called: `.env` and inside this file, you will need to add the following environment variables below:

```bash
PORT=3000

MONGODB_URL=mongodb://root:<your-password>@mongodb_container:27017/?authSource=admin
MONGODB_LOCAL_URL=mongodb://root:<your-password>@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin
MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME=employees-database
```

> You will need to change the values of the environment variables above according to your MongoDB configuration.

We are using Docker to run the application locally. For that, run the following commands below:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

And to see if the container is running, run the following command below:

```bash
docker ps
```

Now, in the root of the project, you will notice that there is a folder called: `rest-client`. Inside this folder, there is a file called: `employees.http`. This file is an HTTP request file that can be executed directly in Visual Studio Code. To execute this file, just click on the button: `Send Request` that is located in the upper right corner of the file. For testing purposes, create some employee records. And then, test the other HTTP requests.

But if you want to see if the docker container is running correctly and up the application, just open your browser and type the following address below:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

If you see the following message below, it's because the application is running correctly:

```bash
{
    "success": "true",
    "message": "Welcome to the DevSquad Employee API!",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

To stop the container, run the following command below:

```bash
docker compose down -- volumes
```
