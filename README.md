## üî• How to run the application locally?

We are using Docker to run the application locally. For that, run the following commands below:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

And to see if the container is running, run the following command below:

```bash
docker ps
```

Now, in the root of the project, you will notice that there is a folder called: `rest-client`. Inside this folder, there is a file called: `employees.http`. This file is an HTTP request file that can be executed directly in Visual Studio Code. To execute this file, just click on the button: `Send Request` that is located in the upper right corner of the file. For testing purposes, create some employee records. And then, test the other HTTP requests.

To stop the container, run the following command below:

```bash
docker compose down -- volumes
```
